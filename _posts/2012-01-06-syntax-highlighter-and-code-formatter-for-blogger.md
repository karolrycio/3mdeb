Another time-waster was a decent code formatter and syntax highlighter.Â I google out [following solution][1], it is based on [SyntaxHighlighter 3][2] It has interesting options:

1.  You can select the language for which a syntax-colored
2.  Turn on/off line numbering
3.  Themes - this one is pretty nice for my blog
4.  Customizable tabs size
5.  The option to disable toolbar

My dream would be to create a theme that would look similar to vim syntax highlighing.
